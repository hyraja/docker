## The first step is to add the GPG key for the official Docker repository:
     $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
## Then add the Docker repository to APT sources:
     $ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
## Next, we update the package database:
     $ sudo apt-get update
## Now we’re ready to install Docker CE:
     $ sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
## Docker CE should now be installed. Check using the docker version command:
     $ docker --version
  Congrats. You’re “almost” all set!
  
# To reduce the need to constantly use sudo. We can do that using the usermod command and add the current user to the docker group. 
     $ sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
     
#Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

If testing on a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.

On a desktop Linux environment such as X Windows, log out of your session completely and then log back in.

On Linux, you can also run the following command to activate the changes to groups: 
     $ newgrp docker

## Now just exist the ssh session and reenter to get the changes to take affect.
## Once you reenter your EC2 instance you type the docker info command for good measure.
     $ docker info
